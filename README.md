## What is Jazztronauts?
Jazztronauts for Lethal Company (developed by @its3dmatt  and @micalobia ) is a fan version of the original Garry's Mod gamemode by Foohy and their team. Just like in the OG game, you are hired to steal and collect items for an interdimensional group of literal jazz cats. Our goal with this sequel is to expand upon the stories and ideas for the characters in Jazztronauts, this time using Lethal Company and Unity Engine as a home for the band.

## Who are the Jazztronauts?
**The Bartender**: The bartender is the leader of the band, often left picking up after the other cats and maintaining the Bar.
**The Singer**: Only communicates to the player with a word pad. They're shy, timid, love toys, and puts their passion into the Mewseum; a section of the Bar showcasing the collection of knicks and knacks as well as pointing out the intricacies of the game engine.
**The Pianist**: A bloodthirsty maniac leaving chaos and destruction in their wake. She loves nothing more than to start a fight.
**The Cellist**: He's cool, sarcastic, and doesn't give a ||darn||. His pastimes include appreciating fine art and history as well as getting higher than a kite strapped to a rocket. 
**You**: You're the new guy; the rookie; ~~the disposable labor~~. Your job is to complete missions for the rest of the band and collect **shards** to appease them. What else are you going to do while drifting through the endless void of space?

## Why Jazztronauts?
Jazztronauts 2 is planned to be an overhaul to the story and gameplay flow of Lethal Company, bringing an outside idea and lore to the game. With the increase of custom moons in LC, we just couldn't resist as Lethal reminded us a lot of the original Jazztronauts as far as gameplay beats. This is 100% a fan project of a niche, underrated, and frankly awesome gamemode that showed the best of what Gmod and the Source Engine had to offer. We hope to do the same for the Lethal Modding community. Development will be lengthy as we want to get this *just* right. But don't worry, we'll release alpha and beta candidates along the way as we reach milestones.

## Where is Jazztronauts?
Jazztronauts 2 will have a hub that is a planned replacement / expansion to the company moon. This will be where the cats give you missions, where you check out the mewseum, bring shards, and buy some sweet upgrades.
